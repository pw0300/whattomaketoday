# Viral PM Writing Style

This skill provides a framework for writing Product Management content that mimics top voices like Shreyas Doshi, Lenny Rachitsky, and Jason Fried. It prioritizes **Narrative Tension** over "Success Stories."

## The 3 Archetypes

### 1. The Sage (Shreyas Doshi)
*   **Role:** The patterns-recognizer.
*   **Tone:** High information density, authoritative, diagnostic.
*   **Hook:** "The [Name] Fallacy: Why most [Role] fail at [Task]."
*   **Use for:** Strategy posts, framework introductions, deeply analytical observations.

### 2. The Direct Builder (Jason Fried)
*   **Role:** The essentialist.
*   **Tone:** Extreme brevity, blunt truths, no adjectives.
*   **Hook:** A simple, counter-intuitive statement. ("User feedback is a trap.")
*   **Use for:** Origin stories, design decisions, "cutting the fluff" narratives.

### 3. The Tactical Problem-Solver (Lenny Rachitsky)
*   **Role:** The deep-dive researcher.
*   **Tone:** Action-oriented, "I suffered so you don't have to."
*   **Hook:** Teasing a major breakthrough after a struggle. ("I spent 48 hours fighting X.")
*   **Use for:** Technical deep dives, "How-To" guides, architecture breakdowns.

## The "Anti-LLM" Rules (How to sound Human)

1.  **Half-Told Stories (The Loop):** Never give the answer in line 1.
    *   ❌ "I optimized my app using caching."
    *   ✅ "I typed `firebase deploy` and everything broke." (Forces a click).
2.  **Kill the Adjectives:** If it ends in "-ly" or "-ive", kill it.
    *   *Banned:* comprehensive, dynamic, seamless, robust, meticulously.
    *   *Allowed:* built, broke, trusted, failed, fixed.
3.  **The "High-Density" Filter:** One idea per line. If a sentence doesn't advance the plot, delete it.
4.  **No Formal Intros:** Start `In Medias Res` (in the middle of the chaos).
5.  **Close the Loop:** If you start with a story (e.g., Mom), end with that story.

## The Formula: Hook -> Struggle -> Transformation -> Insight

### 1. The Hook (The "Lie")
Start by attacking a common assumption or admitting a personal delusion.
*   "Most side projects die because we build for a user who doesn't exist: Ourselves."

### 2. The Struggle (The "Messy Middle")
Show the "Agentic Struggle" or the "Nani Test Failure."
*   "My Mom didn't swipe. She squinted. 'Beta, just show me the list.'"

### 3. The Transformation (The "Pivot")
The moment "Smart You" realized "Stupid You" was wrong.
*   "So I deleted the 'Swipe Deck'. I built a boring 'Grid View'."

### 4. The Insight (The "Takeaway")
A universal truth about Product Management.
*   "Delight isn't animation. Delight is a tool that disappears."

*   Synergy -> (Delete)

*   Transformation -> Change
*   Evolution -> Growth
*   Paradigm Shift -> (Delete)
*   Game-changer -> (Delete)
*   Delve -> (Delete)
*   Unleash -> (Delete)
