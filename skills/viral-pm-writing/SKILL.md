# Viral PM Writing Style

This skill provides a framework for writing Product Management content that mimics top voices like Shreyas Doshi, Lenny Rachitsky, and Peter Yang. It prioritizes **Narrative Tension** over "Success Stories."

## Core Principles

1.  **The Contrarian Hook**: Never start with "I built X." Start with a conflict, a lie, or a counter-intuitive insight.
2.  **Vulnerability as Credibility**: Admit failures (retention cliffs, security leaks, bad metrics). In 2024, "Perfect" = "AI Generated." "Messy" = "Human."
3.  **The "Insight > Feature" Rule**: Don't sell the code. Sell the *observation* about human behavior that necessitated the code.
4.  **Short, Punchy Rhythm**: Design for skimming. One idea per line. No large paragraphs.

## The Formula: Hook -> Struggle -> Transformation -> Insight

### 1. The Hook (The "Lie")
Start by attacking a common assumption or admitting a personal delusion.
*   ❌ *Bad:* "I built a recipe app using Gemini."
*   ✅ *Good:* "Most side projects die because we build for a user who doesn't exist: Ourselves."
*   ✅ *Good:* "I lied to myself on Slide 4 of my pitch deck."

### 2. The Struggle (The "Messy Middle")
Show the "Agentic Struggle" or the "Nani Test Failure."
*   *Example:* "I hired 3 AI Agents. I had to fire 2 of them. They were like caffeinated interns who lied on their resumes."
*   *Example:* "My Mom didn't swipe right. She squinted. 'Beta, just show me the list.'"

### 3. The Transformation (The "Pivot")
The moment "Smart You" realized "Stupid You" was wrong.
*   *Example:* "So I deleted the 'Swipe Deck'. I built a boring 'Grid View'."
*   *Example:* "I realized my 'AI Moat' was just a 20,000-line JSON file I typed manually."

### 4. The Insight (The "Takeaway")
A universal truth about Product Management.
*   *Example:* "Delight isn't animation. Delight is a tool that disappears."
*   *Example:* "If you can't read the code your Agent wrote, you haven't shipped a product. You've signed a liability waiver."

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

*   **No Corporate Speak:** Ban words like "Synergy," "Leverage," "Robust," "Seamless."
*   **Use Sensory Details:** "My heart stopped," "Caffeinated interns," "Under kitchen lights."
*   **Direct & Opinionated:** Don't say "It depends." Take a stance.
*   **Human > AI:** If it sounds like ChatGPT wrote it, rewrite it. Add a typo or a slang if necessary (but prefer just raw honesty).

## Advanced Narrative Patterns (The "Builder's Code")

### 1. The "Jason Fried" Simplicity Test
*   **Rule:** If you wouldn't say it to a friend over coffee, don't write it.
*   **Fix:** "We leveraged AI optimizations" → "We used AI to make it faster."
*   **Fix:** "Seamless integration" → "It just works."

### 2. The "Julian Shapiro" Hook
*   **Rule:** Start in the middle of the chaos (`In Medias Res`).
*   **Pattern:** [Action] -> [Unexpected Result] -> [Why].
*   *Example:* "I deleted 40% of my code yesterday. The app got faster. Here's why." (Better than "How I optimized my app.")

### 3. The "Paul Graham" Insight
*   **Rule:** Good writing is just clear thinking.
*   **Test:** Is your insight surprising? Or is it a platitude?
*   *Platitude:* "PMs need to talk to users."
*   *Surprising:* "Your users are lying to you about their diet."
